      <section class="ereri-content">

        <p>Levi did not believe in places changing people.</p>

        <p>
          He believed in discipline, routine, and the comfort of knowing exactly what to expect when he opened a door. That was why he went to Linagee almost every morning after his shift — same time, same corner table, same order.
        </p>

        <p>Espresso. No sugar.</p>

        <p>
          The coffee was good.<br>
          That was the reason, he told himself.
        </p>

        <p>Eren had been there from the start.</p>

        <p>
          Behind the counter, apron tied too loosely, hair pulled back in a way that never lasted more than an hour. He smiled like it cost him nothing, like friendliness was a reflex instead of a choice. He remembered names, preferences, fragments of stories. It irritated Levi how easily people leaned toward him.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Back again?” Eren had asked the first week, grin sharp, eyes bright.
        </p>

        <p>
          Levi had grunted. “I like consistency.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Eren laughed. “That’s a polite way to say you’re afraid of change.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Levi had scowled at him. Eren had looked pleased.
        </p>

        <p>After a few weeks, it became a pattern.</p>

        <p>
          Sometimes, when the rush thinned and Levi’s cup was empty, Eren would sit across from him. Always uninvited. Always welcome in a way Levi refused to examine too closely.
        </p>

        <p>
          They talked about nothing.<br>
          Work. Customers. The weather. Levi’s permanent frown.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You know,” Eren said once, stirring his own coffee, “if you stopped looking like you’re about to arrest someone, people might talk to you more.”
        </p>

        <p>“I don’t want them to.”</p>

        <p>“That’s what I mean. Coward.”</p>

        <p>
          Levi narrowed his eyes. “I face danger daily.”
        </p>

        <p>“Yeah, but not eye contact,” Eren teased.</p>

        <p>
          Levi scoffed. Eren laughed. And somehow — effortlessly — the world softened around them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eren’s eyes did that thing when he listened. Focused. Open. Like he actually saw Levi, not just the uniform, the scowl, the silence. It was unsettling. Addictive.
        </p>

        <p>Then one day, Levi didn’t go.</p>

        <p>
          A long shift. Paperwork. An excuse that made sense.
        </p>

        <p>And the absence hit harder than he expected.</p>

        <p>
          The coffee tasted wrong elsewhere. Too bitter. Too loud. Too empty. He caught himself glancing at strangers’ hands, at flashes of green in passing faces. At the way people laughed too loudly, without meaning it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eren’s voice lingered — teasing, warm.<br>
          His eyes followed Levi into the night, uninvited.
        </p>

        <p>It annoyed him.<br>It worried him.</p>

        <p>He went back the next day.</p>

        <p>
          The bell rang. The smell wrapped around him. Linagee was unchanged — and there Eren was, behind the counter, like nothing had ever been wrong.
        </p>

        <p>Their eyes met.</p>

        <p>
          Something in Levi’s chest loosened, immediate and undeniable.
        </p>

        <p>
          “There you are,” Eren said, casual, but his smile lingered a fraction too long. “Thought you’d finally ditched me.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Levi took his espresso, fingers steady despite the rush under his skin. “I was busy.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “Uh-huh.” Eren leaned closer. “Missed you too.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Levi stiffened. “Don’t say things you don’t mean.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Eren’s expression shifted — not playful, not joking. Just honest.
        </p>

        <p>“I do mean them.”</p>

        <p>
          They sat together again later, the world narrowing to steam and quiet. Levi watched Eren talk, hands moving, laughter easy. He understood then — with a clarity that unsettled him — that Eren could be more than this.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than coffee.<br>
          More than habit.<br>
          More than a chair across from him.
        </p>

        <p>
          And Levi didn’t know if Eren would ever look at him that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          He lifted his cup. Took a sip. Grounded himself.
        </p>

        <p>“Hey, Levi,” Eren said suddenly.</p>

        <p>“Yes.”</p>

        <p>
          “Would you like to go out sometime?” Eren asked, simple. Brave. “Not just here. With me.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Levi turned his head, jaw tight. Heat crept up his neck, faint but real.
        </p>

        <p>“…Okay,” he said.</p>

        <p>Eren smiled — softer this time.</p>

        <p>Levi took another sip.</p>

        <p>The coffee was perfect.</p>
