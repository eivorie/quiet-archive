        <!-- TEXTE -->
        <article class="oneshot-text">

      <p>Levi had read the same page three times.</p>

      <p>He knew this because the sentence about the river bending north instead of south had started to irritate him on a personal level. The phrasing was elegant, the imagery careful — exactly the kind of thing Eren liked. Exactly the kind of thing Levi usually appreciated.</p>

      <p>Today, it refused to stay in his head.</p>

      <p>He shifted on the couch, book resting open in his hands, thumb marking a place he didn’t actually need marked. The apartment was quiet. Not peaceful — just empty in that specific way it got when Eren wasn’t there. No movement. No warmth drifting in from another room. No familiar presence grounding the space.</p>

      <p>He exhaled through his nose and tried again.</p>

      <p>Two paragraphs in, his thoughts wandered.</p>

      <p>Eren at work.  
      Eren focused, sleeves rolled up.  
      Eren promising, almost casually, <em>Tonight. I’m taking you out.</em></p>

      <p>Levi closed the book and let it fall against his chest.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t even late.</p>

      <p>He glanced at the clock. Still too early. The day stretched ahead of him like something to be endured rather than enjoyed.</p>

      <p>He got up, wandered aimlessly to the kitchen, opened a bottle of wine he’d been saving for no real occasion. Poured himself a glass. Took a slow sip, leaning against the counter.</p>

      <p>The wine was good. Smooth. Warm.</p>

      <p>It didn’t help.</p>

      <p>He wanted to be comfortable. He wanted to relax. Instead, his body stayed alert, restless, like it was waiting for something vital to return. Like the apartment itself hadn’t quite settled without Eren inside it.</p>

      <p>He picked the book back up, determined this time. He wasn't about to bother Eren at work by texting.</p>

      <p>Three lines. Four.</p>

      <p>His eyes traced the words without absorbing them. He could practically hear Eren’s voice reading them aloud, animated, opinionated, stopping every few sentences to comment.</p>

      <p>Levi shut the book again.</p>

      <p>“This is ridiculous,” he muttered to the empty room.</p>

      <p>He wanted Eren.</p>

      <p>The realization was blunt, uncomplicated, and left no room for denial.</p>

      <p>When the door finally opened, Levi reacted without thinking.</p>

      <p>The sound barely registered before he was on his feet, moving fast, crossing the space between them in seconds.</p>

      <p>“Hey, I’m—”</p>

      <p>Eren barely had time to step inside before Levi collided with him, arms wrapping around his shoulders, momentum nearly knocking him back against the door.</p>

      <p>“Levi—!” Eren laughed, startled, hands coming up to steady them both. “What’s gotten into you?”</p>

      <p>Levi didn’t answer. He kissed Eren’s cheek. Then the other. Then his jaw, his temple, the corner of his mouth — quick, insistent, unapologetic. Like he was making up for lost time.</p>

      <p>Eren laughed harder, breathless. “Okay, wow. Where’s my grumpy, annoying boyfriend? And why is he attacking me?”</p>

      <p>Levi pulled back just enough to look at him, eyes sharp, expression earnest.</p>

      <p>“I was bored,” he said flatly.</p>

      <p>Eren blinked. Then smiled, fond and knowing. “You read my book.”</p>

      <p>“Yes.”</p>

      <p>“And hated it?”</p>

      <p>“No.”</p>

      <p>“Then why—”</p>

      <p>Levi leaned in again, forehead resting against Eren’s, voice lower now. “Because I wanted you.”</p>

      <p>The teasing faded instantly.</p>

      <p>Eren’s hands slid to Levi’s waist, warm, grounding. “That bad?”</p>

      <p>Levi nodded once. “You said we were going out.”</p>

      <p>Eren smiled softly and brushed his thumb under Levi’s eye. “We still are.”</p>

      <p>Levi felt the tension drain out of him all at once, like his body had been waiting for permission to relax.</p>

      <p>Eren kissed his forehead, then his nose. “You’re adorable when you miss me.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t say that.”</p>

      <p>“Too late.”</p>

      <p>Levi didn’t argue. He just stayed there, arms still wrapped around Eren, warmth finally back where it belonged.</p>

      <p>His peace was back.</p>
