    <p>Eren had banned him from the kitchen.</p>

    <p>
      Not officially, of course.<br>
      But the chair had been pulled out and placed deliberately near the counter, and Levi had been sat down with a look that brooked no argument.
    </p>

    <p>“Don’t touch anything,” Eren said, already tying the apron around his waist. “Last time your cake was dry enough to be used as a weapon.”</p>

    <p>Levi scoffed. “You ate half of it.”</p>
    <p>“That was pity.”</p>
    <p>“That was hunger.”</p>

    <p>
      Eren laughed — warm, unrestrained — and turned back to the counter, hands already dusted with flour.
      Levi crossed his arms and stayed where he was, pointedly obedient.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside, the winter pressed itself against the windows. Pale light, slow snow, the world reduced to silence and cold. Inside, the small kitchen breathed heat and familiarity — the low hum of the oven, the scent of butter melting, sugar dissolving into something comforting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eren moved with focus. Sleeves rolled up, forearms flexing as he stirred, measured, adjusted. He spoke while he worked, voice easy, narrating without caring whether Levi was listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something about the market being crowded.
      About how the baker had run out of yeast.
      About absolutely nothing important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi listened at first.<br>
      Then — without warning — he didn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      His attention slipped, soft and inevitable, settling entirely on Eren.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way his brow furrowed when he concentrated. The faint dusting of flour along his knuckles. The way he leaned into the counter, solid, warm, undeniably there. The kitchen light caught in his hair, turning it gold, familiar, impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi felt the quiet swell in his chest — that steady, overwhelming certainty that had nothing to do with reason.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">Love.</p>

    <p>
      Not the moment.
      Not the kitchen.
      Not even the man standing in front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sense of being exactly where he was meant to be, without needing to move. Of having nowhere else to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eren glanced over his shoulder. “You’re staring.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi blinked. Reoriented. The room rushed back into place.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I’m supervising,” he said flatly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eren snorted. “You’re zoning out.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Am not.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “You are. You do that thing where your face goes blank but your eyes get… intense.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi huffed. “Don’t flatter yourself.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Eren smiled anyway and turned back to the bowl, humming under his breath. The sound settled into Levi’s bones, low and constant, like a heartbeat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time stretched. Comfortable. Unrushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi watched the snow thicken outside, watched Eren’s hands work with care he pretended not to notice. He thought, absently, that Eren never let him cook when it mattered. That he always insisted. Always made sure Levi was fed, warm, seated.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quiet kind of care.
      The kind that didn’t ask for acknowledgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      It hit Levi all at once — sharp and simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love, he realized, did not always announce itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it just sat you down, handed you warmth, and said: stay.
    </p>
    
    <p>“Eren,” he said suddenly.</p>
    <p>“Yeah?”</p>

    <p>“I love you.”</p>

    <p>
      The sentence landed softly. Like snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eren froze for half a second — then his shoulders relaxed, his smile gentle, unsurprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I know,” he said, fond. “I was wondering when you’d say it out loud.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He stepped closer, leaned down, brushed a flour-dusted kiss against Levi’s temple before returning to the counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Now stay there,” he added. “You’re not allowed to help.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Levi stayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside, winter could do what it wanted.<br>
      Inside, he was exactly where he belonged.
