      <section class="ereri-content">

        <p>Levi let himself sink deeper into the bath, shoulders slipping under the surface as warm water closed over him. The bathroom lights were dimmed, steam clinging lazily to the mirror. His muscles loosened, one by one, but the quiet remained heavy.</p>

        <p>There was nothing wrong with today.</p>

        <p>That was the problem.</p>

        <p>Eren was away for work. Nothing unusual. No danger, no tension, no reason to ache the way Levi did. And yet — the absence pressed against him all the same, dull and persistent, like a bruise he kept forgetting to protect.</p>

        <p>He rested his head back against the tub, eyes closed, fingers drifting through the water. The apartment felt too big without Eren’s presence filling it. Too neat. Too still.</p>

        <p>He reached for his phone.</p>

        <div class="text-thread">
          <div class="text eren"><span>Long day. Meetings back to back. I’m exhausted.</span></div>
          <div class="text levi"><span>Sounds like hell.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>Worth it if it means I get home to you soon.</span></div>
          <div class="text levi"><span>I miss you.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>…</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>I miss you too.</span></div>
          <div class="text levi"><span>It’s boring without you here.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>I know.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>Try to relax for me, okay?</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>Levi stared at the screen for a moment longer than necessary before locking it. He knew Eren wouldn’t make a show of it — never did. Affection, for him, was quieter. Something prepared in advance, held back until it mattered.</p>

        <p>The water cooled slowly. Night crept in.</p>

        <p>Levi had just pulled on a shirt when the doorbell rang.</p>

        <p>He frowned, dried hands barely wrapped in a towel as he opened the door.</p>

        <p>The delivery was simple. Unassuming. A bundle of red roses intertwined with white flowers — lilies, soft and deliberate, arranged with care rather than extravagance.</p>

        <div class="flowers">
          White. Clean. Calm.
        </div>

        <p>His phone buzzed.</p>

        <div class="text-thread">
          <div class="text eren"><span>Got them?</span></div>
          <div class="text levi"><span>…You’re impossible.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>You feel safe to me.</span></div>
          <div class="text eren"><span>White is what I associate with that.</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>Levi swallowed.</p>

        <p>The ache softened — not gone, but eased. Like being held from afar. Like knowing someone had thought of him without needing a reason.</p>

        <p>He set the flowers carefully on the table, fingers brushing the petals with more care than he’d ever admit.</p>

        <p>“I miss you,” he murmured to the empty apartment.</p>

        <p>And for the first time that evening, the quiet didn’t hurt quite as much.</p>
