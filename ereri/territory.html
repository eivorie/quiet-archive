    <article class="ereri-content">

      <p>Levi didn’t say anything at the bar.</p>

      <p>That alone should have been warning enough.</p>

      <p>The place was loud — glasses clinking, laughter spilling over itself, music too confident for its own good. Friends crowded around the table, half-drunk and nostalgic, stories tumbling out without much thought.</p>

      <p>Someone mentioned Eren’s name.<br>
      Someone else mentioned <em>before</em>.</p>

      <p>“Oh yeah,” one of them laughed, “remember when Eren was seeing that guy back then? God, that was a mess.”</p>

      <p>The sentence was careless.<br>
      The tone light.</p>

      <p>Levi’s grip tightened around his glass.</p>

      <p>Eren didn’t look at him. He didn’t need to. Levi could feel the shift in his posture anyway — the instinctive awareness, the quiet <em>I know</em> between them. Eren deflected easily, joked it away, changed the subject like he always did.</p>

      <p>Levi stayed silent.</p>

      <p>This wasn’t the place.<br>
      These weren’t the people.<br>
      And Eren wasn’t something to be claimed out loud like territory on a map.</p>

      <p>Still — the thought lodged itself deep, sharp and unwelcome.</p>

      <p>Someone else had held him.<br>
      Someone else had been trusted with his laughter, his warmth, his softness.</p>

      <p>Levi hated how much it unsettled him.</p>

      <p>He trusted Eren. Completely.<br>
      That wasn’t the issue.</p>

      <p>The issue was older than reason. Deeper than logic.</p>

      <p>The idea that something so vital to him had ever belonged to someone else — even briefly — made his chest ache in a way he didn’t have words for.</p>

      <p>They left early.</p>

      <p>At home, the quiet pressed in immediately — familiar, safe. Coats discarded, shoes kicked aside. The world shrank to walls and warm light.</p>

      <p>Levi busied himself with nothing.<br>
      Eren watched him for a minute.</p>

      <p>Then, gently, “You’ve been quiet.”</p>

      <p>Levi didn’t answer.</p>

      <p>Eren stepped closer. “Levi.”</p>

      <p>He exhaled slowly, jaw tight. “I know it’s stupid.”</p>

      <p>Eren didn’t interrupt.</p>

      <p>“I know you didn’t do anything wrong,” Levi continued, voice low. “I know you’re with me. I trust you. This isn’t—” He paused, frustrated. “It’s not about logic.”</p>

      <p>Eren nodded, expression calm, attentive.</p>

      <p>“It just—” Levi swallowed. “I don’t like thinking about someone else having you. Having that version of you. I don’t like that they existed in a place I care about.”</p>

      <p>He looked away, annoyed with himself. “I know you don’t belong to me like an object. I know that. But you’re… mine. And I’m yours. And sometimes my head doesn’t know how to shut up about it.”</p>

      <p>For a moment, there was only silence.</p>

      <p>Then Eren stepped in front of him, close enough that Levi could feel his warmth.</p>

      <p>“You’re not stupid,” Eren said softly. “You’re human.”</p>

      <p>Levi scoffed. “Debatable.”</p>

      <p>Eren smiled faintly. “I don’t mind that you feel things deeply. I never have.” He lifted a hand, hesitant only for a second, then cupped the side of Levi’s face. “Nothing from before takes anything away from us. From you.”</p>

      <p>Levi’s eyes flickered up.</p>

      <p>“I chose you,” Eren said. “I choose you. Every day.”</p>

      <p>The tension in Levi’s chest cracked, slow and painful, like ice thawing.</p>

      <p>“I know,” he muttered.</p>

      <p>“And,” Eren added, amused, “for the record — you’re not the only territorial one here.”</p>

      <p>That earned a huff of reluctant laughter.</p>

      <p>Before Levi could look away, Eren leaned in.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t rushed.<br>
      It wasn’t gentle in the way apologies were.</p>

      <p>Eren’s hand slid to the back of Levi’s neck, fingers firm, grounding — unmistakably there. The kiss was brief but deliberate, pressed with intent rather than softness, as if Eren were reminding him of something fundamental.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">Mine.</p>

      <p>Levi felt it all the way down to his spine.</p>

      <p>When Eren pulled back, he didn’t move far. Their foreheads nearly touched. Levi opened his eyes and met Eren’s gaze, close enough to see the warmth there, steady and unwavering.</p>

      <p>It settled him instantly.</p>

      <p>That warmth — that quiet certainty — spread through his chest, easing the ache, silencing the noise. A power Eren had over him that Levi never fought. Never wanted to.</p>

      <p>He exhaled, slow, controlled.</p>

      <p>“Come on,” Eren said. “You’ve had a long night.”</p>

      <p>Levi barely had time to react before Eren wrapped him up in a blanket on the couch, methodical and unapologetic, folding him in until there was nowhere else to go.</p>

      <p>“A burrito?” Levi deadpanned.</p>

      <p>“A very grumpy one.”</p>

      <p>Eren settled behind him, arms secure, chin resting lightly against Levi’s head. Warm. Steady. Unmoving.</p>

      <p>Levi let himself sink back.</p>

      <p>The world went quiet.</p>

      <p>“It’s okay,” Eren murmured. “I’ve got you.”</p>

      <p>Levi closed his eyes.</p>

      <p class="final-line">He always had.</p>
