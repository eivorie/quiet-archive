  <article class="oneshot-text">

    <p>Paris had a way of pretending nothing extraordinary ever happened there. As if history did not linger in the stones, as if love did not leave fingerprints on iron railings and café tables. </p>
    <p>Levi sat on the terrace because it was habit, not desire. Black coat tailored close to the body, gloves folded beside his coffee, posture precise — a man who belonged nowhere and everywhere at once. He had learned long ago that restraint was a form of survival.</p> 
    <p>Then Eren walked past.</p> 
    <p>It wasn’t dramatic. No thunder, no sudden silence. Just the smallest shift in the air — the kind Levi had learned to notice because it meant danger, or change, or both.</p> 
    <p>Eren didn’t stop at first. He moved like someone who knew the city would part for him if he asked it to. Hair unruly despite careful dressing, brown strands catching the light in a way Levi found offensive in its ease. His suit was well-fitted but worn like an afterthought, sleeves pushed back just enough to expose hands that moved as if they were constantly deciding between restraint and impulse.</p>
    <p>Levi forgot to breathe.</p> 
    <p>It hit him not like attraction, but like recognition.</p> 
    <p>Those eyes — green, sharp, too alive — skimmed the terrace once, uninterested, confident. Then they paused. Not on the crowd. Not on the street.</p>
    <p>On Levi.</p> 
    <p>The look lasted no more than a second. But in that second, something inside Levi folded inward, precise and final, like a lock clicking shut.</p> 
    <p>There you are.</p>
    <p>The thought did not frighten him. That was the most alarming part.</p>
    <p>Eren turned, hesitated, then stepped toward the empty chair opposite Levi as if the decision had already been made somewhere else. As if he were merely following instructions written long before either of them learned their own names.</p>
    <p>“May I?” Eren asked, already pulling the chair back.</p> 
    <p>Levi nodded once. He trusted his voice even less than his hands.</p>
    <p>Up close, it was worse.</p>
    <p>Eren smelled faintly of wood and something warm — leather, maybe, or sun. His confidence was not arrogance; it was certainty. The kind that came from knowing you would be caught if you fell.</p>
    <p>Their conversation was unremarkable. Weather. Coffee. A remark about the street being louder than usual.</p>
    <p>And yet — Levi felt as though every word was a test he had already passed.</p>
    <p>He noticed everything.</p>
    <p>The way Eren’s fingers tapped twice against the porcelain cup when he listened. The faint scar near his knuckle, half-hidden, like a secret he had decided not to talk about. The way his mouth curved when amused — not fully smiling, but allowing the possibility.</p>
    <p>Eren watched Levi too. Carefully. Not greedily.</p>
    <p>As if he were memorizing the shape of him.</p>
    <p>There were moments — brief, unguarded — when Eren’s confidence cracked just enough to let something else surface. Something softer. Older. Those looks were rare, fleeting, and Levi understood immediately that they were not for the world.</p>
    <p>They were for him.</p>
    <p>The realization settled heavy and intimate in his chest.</p>
    <p>This man does not belong to me, Levi thought. And just as quickly: I belong to him.</p>
    <p>The certainty was suffocating in its calm.</p>
    <p>It felt like stepping into a room you had once lived in — furniture gone, walls repainted — yet knowing exactly where the light switch was without looking.</p>
    <p>A déjà vu so profound it bordered on grief.</p>
    <p>They had done this before. Loved each other, lost each other, searched lifetimes for the echo of it.</p>
    <p>Levi was sure of it. When Eren stood to leave, adjusting his coat, he paused. His hand brushed Levi’s shoulder — accidental, polite, devastating.</p>
    <p>“For what it’s worth,” Eren said softly, eyes steady, unreadable, “I’m glad I sat down.”</p>
    <p>Levi looked up at him, heart tight, breath shallow.</p>
    <p>“So am I,” he replied.</p>
    <p>Eren smiled then — fully this time — and walked away.</p>
    <p>Levi remained seated long after the coffee had gone cold, fingers curled slowly into his gloves.</p>
    <p>He did not wonder if he loved him.</p>
    <p>He wondered how long he had been searching.</p>
