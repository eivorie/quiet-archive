        If you’re reading this today, it means joy found you —<br>
        and you came here to share a little of it with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meu amor, do you know what happens to me when you’re happy?<br>
        Everything in my world shifts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The noise fades, the weight lifts, and suddenly there is nothing but you —
        your voice, your laugh, your light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your happiness is contagious in the most beautiful way.
        Even from miles away, I feel it in my chest like a spark catching flame.
      </p>

      <p>
        And God, that laugh of yours…
        That soft chuckle, the breath you let out right before you smile —
        I hear it in my mind as if you were right next to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I replay your audios just to hear that sound again,
        that warmth, that little burst of life that escapes you without warning.
        It gets to me every single time.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then there’s that thing —
        the tiny muscle between your ear and your jaw that “clicks” when you smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meu amor, I notice it every time.
        It’s ridiculous how much I love it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way your eyes soften, the curve of your lips,
        the quiet joy that moves across your face…
        it all hits me at once, like a wave.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re beautiful when you’re serious,
        but when you’re happy?
        You’re something else entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love seeing you like that.
        I love knowing that life still makes you laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love the stories you tell me —
        the disasters, the chaos, the absurd things that happen to you for no reason at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make me laugh so much, sometimes I have to stop what I’m doing just to breathe again.
        You’re hilarious without trying, and I adore that about you.
      </p>

      <p>
        But more than anything, I adore the way your joy connects with mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment you smile, a part of me wakes up too.
        Your happiness doesn’t just brighten your day —
        it brightens mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make everything feel lighter, softer, real.
        And when you're happy, I can’t help but be happy with you.
      </p>

      <p>
  I hope today is one of those days where everything feels a little easier, a little brighter.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you smiled — really smiled — with your eyes and that tiny click I love.
</p>

<p>
  I hope something made you laugh out loud, the way you do when you forget to hold it back.
</p>

<p>
  And I hope you remember this:
</p>

<p>
  Your happiness is never small to me.<br>
  It’s a gift.<br>
  A treasure.<br>
  A moment I keep close even when the day ends.
</p>
      <p class="weather-ending">
        So if you’re happy right now, amor…<br>
        stay in it a little longer.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        Let it fill you.<br>
        Let it warm you.<br>
        And know that somewhere, I’m smiling too — because of you.
      </p>
