      <p class="weather-lead">
        If you’re reading this today, it means you fell into one of those bleh days again —
        not sad, not angry, not overwhelmed… just off.
        Just grey around the edges.
        Just tired in a way even you can’t explain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meu amor, my sunshine, my brat — come here a little closer.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to know what you’re feeling.
        You don’t have to make sense of it or name it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some days are just like this for you, and that’s okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        You get quiet, your voice softens, your mind drifts,
        and suddenly everything feels heavy for no good reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        You sleep more, you disappear a little, you answer slower.
        You already know I notice it each time.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I don’t need a reason to hold space for you.
        You don’t owe me explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bleh” is enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        But babe, let me tell you something gently —
        you don’t have to stay stuck in that feeling alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish you could see how I see you on days like this:
        still beautiful, still soft, still worth loving in every possible way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when you’re quiet.
        Even when you feel like nothing special.
        Even when you think you’re boring or distant or impossible to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re none of that to me.
        You’re still my love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still the boy who laughs so loudly on other days,
        who tells me the most ridiculous stories,
        who lights up my whole chest when he smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your “bleh” doesn’t scare me away —
        it just makes me want to take care of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish I could be next to you right now,
        running my fingers through your hair while you drift in and out of sleep,
        letting your mind rest without having to pretend you’re okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’d hold you until the heaviness softened,
        until you breathed easier,
        until the world felt a little lighter again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it will.
        It always does.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, just remember this:
        you’re allowed to have days where you don’t shine.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re allowed to be bratty or needy or distant or quiet.
        You’re allowed to sleep until your heart resets.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I’ll still be right here,
        loving you through every version of yourself —
      </p>

      <p>
        the bright one,
        the soft one,
        the chaotic one,
        the jealous one,
        and even the “bleh” one.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        So rest, amor.
        Let your mind drift.
        Let the fog pass.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        And when you feel a little more like you again,
        I'll annoy the hell out of you.
        You know, being “chata” is my best asset.
      </p>
