    <h1>Rest with me for a minute ?</h1>

    <div class="weather-text">

      <p class="weather-lead">
        If you’re reading this today, it means the world felt heavy again —<br>
        and you ended up here, with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My love, I wish I could pull you into my arms right now. I wish I could be the warmth you lean on,
        the voice that steadies you, the presence that quiets the storm inside your mind.
        I know days like this happen more often than you let people see.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know the distance weighs on you, and the memories of home tug at your heart,
        and sometimes it’s not even for a clear reason — sometimes you just feel low,
        and that’s okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        But listen to me.<br>
        Really listen.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are loved.<br>
        Not in a vague, distant way — in the most real, stubborn, unshakable way.<br>
        By me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see you, every day, even from a distance. I see how much you carry.
        How much you try. How much you give to the world without even noticing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        You wake up, you keep going, you show kindness even when your own heart feels tired.
        You’re honest, you’re brave, you’re gentle, you’re stronger than you know —
        and none of that disappears just because today hurts a little more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes you talk about yourself like you’re just “getting by.”
        But you’re not.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re surviving life with a courage you don’t even recognize as courage.
        You’re building a future while holding the weight of two homes —
        the one you left and the one we’re creating together.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re balancing longing, dreams, fear, love, and responsibility.
        And still, you remain soft.
        Still, you remain you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m proud of you.
        So proud it hurts in my chest when I think about it.
        Because I know your battles — at least the ones you allow me to see —
        and I’m honored that you let me close enough to witness them.
      </p>

      <p>
        If today feels dark, my love, remember this:<br>
        you don’t need to shine for me.
        You don’t need to be strong, or cheerful, or perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m here for you exactly as you are,
        especially on the days you can’t carry yourself alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are exceptional.
        Not because of what you achieve, not because of what you show —
        but because of who you are at the core.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have this light in you, this warmth, this softness that you offer to others without thinking.
        You make people feel safe. You make people feel seen.
        You make me feel like home.
      </p>

      <p>
        And maybe you don’t realize any of that.
        Maybe you never have.
        But I see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I’ll keep reminding you, again and again,
        for as long as you need.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        I love you — in the quiet moments and the stormy ones,
        in the days where you shine and the days where you bend under the weight of everything.
        I’m not going anywhere.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        Come here whenever the world feels too much.<br>
        I’ll be right here, waiting for you.<br>
        Always.
      </p>
