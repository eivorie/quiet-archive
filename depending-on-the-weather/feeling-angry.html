      <p class="weather-lead">
        If you’re reading this right now, it means something went wrong —
        something upset you, something pushed too hard, something stung more than it should have.
        And you ended up here, with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meu amor, I know how you get when you’re angry.
        You pull back, your words get sharper, you breathe differently,
        everything in you tenses.
      </p>

      <p>
        And honestly?
        I’m often right there with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re angry, there’s a good chance I’m angry too —
        or hurt, or defensive, or just overwhelmed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We flare up together.
        We push, we pull, we misunderstand each other, we get stubborn.
        That’s us.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here’s the truth beneath all of it:
        if you’re feeling something, then it matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your emotions are valid — always.
        Even when they’re messy.
        Even when they’re loud.
        Even when they make no sense on the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to hide your anger from me.
        You don’t have to pretend you’re fine,
        or swallow it,
        or act like it’s nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re allowed to feel whatever you feel —
        jealousy, irritation, frustration, fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know those feelings hit you fast.
        I know they burn hot.
        And it’s okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        It doesn’t make you difficult.
        It doesn’t make you wrong.
        It just makes you human.
        It makes you you.
      </p>

      <p>
        And you know us —
        we argue, we get sharp, we take things personally, and then…
      </p>

      <p>
        we breathe.
        We take a step back.
        We soften.
        We listen.
      </p>

      <p>
        We talk again, properly this time,
        with the kind of honesty that only comes after the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        We choose each other again and again —
        even on the days we clash.
      </p>

      <p>
        So if you’re angry right now, sunshine, let me say this:
        I’m not your enemy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not on the other side of the fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if we’re both hurting,
        even if we’re both stubborn,
        I’m still here with you,
        not against you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take your time.
        Breathe.
        Let the storm pass through you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to fix anything right this second.
        You don’t have to be calm immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just stay with me —
        even in silence —
        and when you’re ready,
        we’ll talk.
      </p>

      <p>
        We always do.
      </p>

      <p>
        And no matter what sparked your anger today,
        remember this:
        I love you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only when you’re soft.
        Not only when you’re calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        But also when you’re burning,
        when you’re raw,
        when you're trying to protect yourself
        in the only ways you know how.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to be perfect for me.
        You just have to be you.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        And even now — especially now —
        I’m right here,
        and I love you.
      </p>
