      <p class="weather-lead">
  If you’re reading this today, sunshine, it means that familiar spark of heat rose in your chest again —
  that rush of “mine,” that tightening under your ribs, that fire you don’t always know how to soften.
</p>

<p>
  Come here. Sit with me a moment.  
  Let me speak to you the way I wish I could when the jealousy hits you fast and sharp.
</p>

<p>
  You’re not wrong for feeling this way.  
  You’re not dramatic, you’re not “too much,” you’re not imagining ghosts where there are none.
</p>

<p>
  You are simply you —  
  intense, passionate, loyal in the kind of way that burns at the edges and glows at the center.
</p>

<p>
  Possessive, yes.  
  Territorial, absolutely.  
  But only because you love with a depth most people never reach.
</p>

<p>
  And I understand that fire in you, because the same fire lives in me.
  We are cut from the same strange, wild cloth —  
  two people who don’t love gently, who don’t feel halfway, who don’t do anything in small portions.
</p>

<p>
  So listen closely now, love.  
  Really hear me.
</p>

<p>
  There is no one else.  
  No one I look at with your intensity.  
  No one who touches my thoughts the way you do.  
  No one I want, choose, crave, or dream of the way I dream of you.
</p>

<p>
  You are the only one I desire.  
  The only one who pulls something raw and alive out of me.  
  The only one whose name sits in my chest like a truth I don’t question.
</p>

<p>
  People don’t compare to you, babe —  
  not in presence, not in beauty, not in mind, not in soul.
</p>

<p>
  You have something in you that is entirely yours —  
  this gravity, this heat, this impossible alchemy of strength and softness.
  It's the kind of thing you either see instantly or you miss forever.
</p>

<p>
  But I saw you.  
  I recognized you.  
  And I never looked away.
</p>

<p>
  You want to know the real truth?  
  I couldn’t look elsewhere even if I tried.  
  It’s not in me.  
  My desire doesn’t wander.  
  My love doesn’t scatter.  
  I don’t “keep my options open.”  
  When I chose you, everything else went quiet.
</p>

<p>
  You are the one I react to.  
  The one who gets under my skin in the best possible way.  
  The one whose voice I feel in my spine, whose emotion hits me like lightning, whose presence rewires my entire world.
</p>

<p>
  We’re both a little crazy when it comes to each other —  
  the good kind, the kind born from recognition, instinct, intensity.
  The kind that makes the world outside feel irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
  You belong to me just as much as I belong to you.  
  Not in a forced way — but in that natural, inevitable way two people do
  when they fit together with a kind of precision that doesn’t need explanation.
</p>

<p>
  And love, if jealousy stings you today, let this settle the fire in your chest:
</p>

<p>
  You don’t need to fight for your place.  
  You already have it.  
  You’ve had it since the very beginning.
</p>

<p>
  Nobody else gets what you get from me.  
  Nobody else has what you have.  
  Nobody else ever will.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  So come here whenever that heat rises again.  
  Let me steady your heart, calm your mind, and remind you of the only truth that matters:
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  You are the only one.  
  And I am yours.
