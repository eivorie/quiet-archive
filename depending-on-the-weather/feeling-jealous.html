      <p class="weather-lead">
        If you’re reading this today, it means something stirred that familiar feeling in your chest —
        that sharp little ache, that sudden heat, that fear you don’t always know how to name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sunshine, sit with me a moment.
        Let me talk to you the way I wish I could when I feel your jealousy rising.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re not wrong for feeling this way.
        You’re not dramatic, you’re not “too much,” and you’re not imagining things.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re just… you.
        Intense.
        Passionate.
        Possessive in a way that comes from caring too deeply, not from wanting to control.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s who you are — territorial, protective, driven by love and instinct.
        And I understand that.
        We are the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you hear me call someone beautiful, or when you imagine someone looking at me,
        something in you tightens.
      </p>

      <p>
        You get irritated, you make a comment, you distance yourself a little —
        but underneath all of that, I know there’s fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fear that someone else might steal what you love.
        Fear that you might lose the place you’ve taken in my heart.
        Fear that I could look at someone the way I look at you.
      </p>

      <p>
        But babe…
        I don’t.
        And I won’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your jealousy doesn’t push me away —
        it just shows me how much I matter to you.
        And I’m not going anywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one compares to you.
        No one touches my mind, my heart, my body, my everything the way you do.
        No one ever has.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have this presence — this gravity —
        that pulls me in without even trying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your voice, your eyes, the way you say my name,
        the way your emotions hit with full force…
        nothing about you is replaceable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nobody else has that effect on me.
        Nobody else ever makes me feel that spark
        that goes straight to the center of me.
      </p>

      <p>
        You want to know the truth?
        I kind of like that you get jealous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not because I want you to suffer — never —
        but because it reminds me how deeply you feel,
        how fiercely you hold on to what you love.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s one of the many ways your heart speaks,
        even when your words get tangled.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I need you to hear this clearly, love:
        you never need to worry about losing me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to someone beautiful.
        Not to someone charming.
        Not to anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        My heart has already chosen you,
        fully, stubbornly, irreversibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are my soulmate,
        the one I think of,
        the one I wait for,
        the one I would cross oceans for without hesitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If jealousy hits you today,
        let this remind you of one thing:
        you don’t need to fight for your place.
      </p>

      <p>
        You already have it.
        You’ve had it from the start.
        And nothing — absolutely nothing —
        will take me away from you.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        Come here when you feel that sting again.
        Let me calm your mind, hold your heart, and remind you:
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        you are the only one.
      </p>
