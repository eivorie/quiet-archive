      <p class="weather-lead">
  If you’re here tonight, meu amor, it’s because you’re missing us —  
  that thing we become when we’re together, the gravity between us that never really lets go.
</p>

<p>
  You and I… we’ve never been good at staying untouched.  
  We try — we pretend we can be reasonable, patient, calm —  
  but the truth is we burn too close for that.
</p>

<p>
  Every time we talk about seeing each other, it becomes impossible to ignore.  
  That pull.  
  That ache.  
  That quiet hunger under the skin that grows no matter how polite we try to be.
</p>

<p>
  You’re such a gentle soul, you know that?  
  Kind in a way that feels rare, soft in ways most people never get to see.  
  You’re cuddly, warm, sweet in a thousand small ways that melt me without even trying.
</p>

<p>
  But then… there’s the other part of you.  
  The shift.  
  The moment your eyes darken a shade, when your voice drops,  
  when something in you stops pretending it can hold back.
</p>

<p>
  I feel it every time.  
  That change in the air.  
  That heat crawling up my spine.  
  The way your whole presence turns heavier, more certain, more deliberate —  
  like you’re done waiting, like you’ve decided exactly what you want.
</p>

<!-- DARKER BLOCKS START -->

<p>
  And you don’t even have to touch me —  
  you just tell me what’s going to happen,  
  and it’s like my whole mind folds in on itself.  
  No matter the mood we were in a minute before,  
  no matter how calm or silly or distracted we were…  
  the second your voice drops and you take control,  
  I’m gone.
</p>

<p>
  It’s ridiculous how easily you do it.  
  How one sentence from you can pull the ground out from under me,  
  how your tone alone can quiet every thought I have.  
  You speak, and I respond — instantly, instinctively —  
  like my body remembers you even stronger than my mind does.
</p>

<p>
  You describe everything with such certainty, such precision,  
  that I fall into it without resistance.  
  You paint the whole moment, the whole atmosphere,  
  and I follow you all the way down every single time.  
  You could go for hours —  
  and I’d stay right there with you,  
  lost, obedient, wanting,  
  unable to pull myself out of the place your words put me in.
</p>

<p>
  And the truth?  
  I don’t want to pull myself out.  
  I like the way you take control.  
  I like the way you dismantle my defenses like it’s nothing.  
  I like the way I unravel for you,  
  even when we’re miles apart.
</p>

<!-- DARKER BLOCKS END -->

<p>
  And the worst — or the best — part?  
  I match you.  
  I always have.  
  It doesn’t matter how much distance there is, or how many hours of restraint we try to build.  
  My mind shifts the second yours does.
</p>

<p>
  You go dark, and I go breathless.  
  You lower your voice, and I lose my balance.  
  You say my name with that tone — that quiet claiming — and my whole body answers before I think.
</p>

<p>
  We’re not subtle, you and I.  
  Not really.  
  We try to talk about normal things, to keep it light, to behave…  
  but beneath every conversation there’s this tension waiting for a door to open.
</p>

<p>
  Missing you feels physical.  
  Like my hands remember you even if they’ve never held you properly.  
  Like my body leans toward you without permission.  
  Like somewhere between your softness and your fire, you carved out a place in me that throbs when you’re too far.
</p>

<p>
  And I know you feel it too.  
  That inability to tell me no, that weakness we have for each other.  
  That pressure that builds until one of us breaks first and admits exactly what’s happening.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  So if you’re here because you’re missing us…  
  just know I feel it too.  
  Every shift, every pulse, every pull.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  You’re not the only one who struggles to keep their hands off.  
  You’re not the only one who loses their breath when the mood darkens.  
  You’re not the only one who wants.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  We are two halves of the same spark, meu amor —  
  and missing you is just my body remembering where it belongs.
