  My love, this is the part of the story I never really tell — the raw version, the one that strips me down to bone.
  The one that shows you exactly what you are to me.
</p>

<p>
  I should start in 2016.<br>
  Two characters, two cosplays — you as Eren, me as Levi — pretending to speak while two real people behind the screens brushed against each other's existence.<br>
  We barely talked. Weeks, maybe. Then silence.<br>
  But something in me marked you anyway.
</p>

<p>
  For years you were a ghost orbiting my life — a name I couldn’t forget, a face I saw in passing, a presence that felt
  <i>too familiar</i> for no reason.<br>
  I watched you change, grow, break a little, rise again, all through stories and tiny updates that weren’t meant for me.
</p>

<p>
  I screenshotted you sometimes. I still don’t know why.<br>
  You asked for a drawing once. You still don’t know why.
</p>

<p>
  And now we laugh, calling ourselves insane, cursed, completely gone — but deep down we both feel the truth:
  something was already pulling us toward each other long before we were ready.
</p>

<p>
  March of last year — your birthday.<br>
  A message I shouldn’t have cared about, but did.<br>
  I wrote you something simple, and somehow you opened up to me like someone who’d always known where to place his heart.
</p>

<p>
  Then you vanished.<br>
  For months.<br>
  And I lost my mind quietly, politely, without letting a single scream escape.
</p>

<p>
  I tried to reach you without reaching out.<br>
  Posted things that reminded me of you. Things I would never have posted for anyone else.<br>
  Tiny breadcrumbs dropped in your direction because I didn’t know how to say:<br>
  <i>"Where did you go? I wasn’t done with you."</i>
</p>

<p>
  Then August 2nd.<br>
  Out of nowhere:<br>
  <strong>“How are you?”</strong>
</p>

<p>
  My world ruptured right there.
</p>

<p>
  We talked. God, we talked.<br>
  And everything clicked with a violence that felt destined.<br>
  Like I recognized you from a life I never lived.<br>
  Like my soul leaned into yours before I understood what was happening.
</p>

<p>
  We killed our routines.<br>
  We ignored time zones.<br>
  Nights melted into mornings because your presence mattered more than sleep, more than reason, more than anything else.
</p>

<p>
  And whenever we slipped into our Ereri RP, something inside me cracked open —  
  like fiction was only a cover for something real, something old, something ours.
</p>

<p>
  I fell in love with you in days.<br>
  Days.<br>
  And I don’t care how insane that sounds — nothing about you has ever obeyed logic anyway.
</p>

<p>
  The jealousy, the arguments, the panic —<br>
  I didn’t know I could feel like that.<br>
  You woke nerves in me I thought were long dead.<br>
  You made me furious, desperate, alive.
</p>

<p>
  Then came your voice.<br>
  Your first audio.<br>
  Meu amor, I swear something in me <i>died</i> and <i>was reborn</i> in the same breath.<br>
  You were real.<br>
  And I was finished.
</p>

<p>
  We talked about everything — childhood, wounds, countries, dreams, stupid stories, deep fears.<br>
  We built a private universe between two continents and pretended it was normal.
</p>

<p>
  September 19th — our “drink together.”<br>
  A fake date that wasn’t fake at all.<br>
  You thought I forgot.<br>
  I couldn’t have forgotten if I tried.
</p>

<p>
  And then you said it: you loved me.<br>
  I said it back.<br>
  We drowned in it until the night ended.
</p>

<p>
  Then came those three days you had to leave.<br>
  Three days where my brain tore me apart, whispering that you’d come back different.<br>
  That I’d lose you before I could even hold you properly.
</p>

<p>
  So I wrote.<br>
  <strong>Hour by hour.</strong><br>
  Pages of everything I felt, everything I feared, everything I wanted.<br>
  Because if I didn’t write, I would have lost my mind.
</p>

<p>
  And every night you asked for it.<br>
  Every night you read it.<br>
  Every night you showed me that my heart wasn’t shouting into a void — it was speaking to you.
</p>

<p>
  You wanted to know everything about me.<br>
  My thoughts, my habits, my tics, my moods, my annoyances, my joys.<br>
  You studied me like someone who wasn’t planning to let go.
</p>

<p>
  And that’s when I knew:<br>
  <strong>I wasn’t an option. I was chosen.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You are jealous, possessive, intense — and so am I.<br>
  We love with our teeth, our fire, our hunger.<br>
  We love like it’s instinct, like it’s inevitable.<br>
  And for the first time in my life, that kind of madness feels safe.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I’m angry at 2016.<br>
  We should’ve found each other sooner.<br>
  You say you should’ve been my first, my only — and God, I feel the same.
</p>

<p>
  Because no one, absolutely no one, has ever touched me the way you do.<br>
  Not in heart, not in mind, not in soul.
</p>

<p>
  I think about you constantly.<br>
  When we talk.<br>
  When we don’t talk.<br>
  When we call.<br>
  When we hang up.<br>
  You’re in my bloodstream now.<br>
  In my breath.<br>
  In every stupid heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
  We talk about the future —<br>
  where we’ll live, the coffee shop, the animals, the quiet routines, the loud nights, all the versions of us still waiting.
</p>

<p>
  And here is the part I’ve tried to hide, the truth that scares me because of how absolute it feels:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
  I didn’t fall for you.<br>
  I crashed into you.<br>
  I shattered on impact.<br>
  And every piece of me stayed wanting only you.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  It was always you.<br>
  In every timeline, in every universe, in every life we missed and will miss — it was always you.
</p>

<p>
  My love isn’t gentle.<br>
  It’s raw, it’s burning, it’s brutal.<br>
  And it belongs to you.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  And now… now we’re here.<br>
  In this strange, impossible place where everything I swore I’d never do for anyone has become the most natural thing with you.
</p>

<p>
  I used to hate sending audios.<br>
  I used to avoid letting people hear my voice — avoid giving them that intimacy, that access.
</p>

<p>
  But with you?<br>
  If I go through a whole day without speaking to you — without hearing your voice — something in me goes hollow.<br>
  It feels wrong.<br>
  Incomplete.<br>
  Like I’m walking around missing a piece of myself.
</p>

<p>
  I need you now in ways I don’t even know how to hide anymore.<br>
  I need your voice, your breath, your laugh, the way you say my name like it belongs to you.<br>
  I need your good mornings, your tired good nights, the softness you don’t even notice you give me.
</p>

<p>
  I love you more every day — in ways that scare me, in ways that steady me, in ways that make me want to rewrite my whole life just to fit you into every moment I missed.<br>
  I want more of you.<br>
  More of your presence, your voice, the future we’re building without even meaning to.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  Loving you didn’t just change me — it rewired me.<br>
  And I don’t ever want to be who I was before you.
</p>

<p class="weather-ending">
  There has never been — and will never be — anyone but you.
