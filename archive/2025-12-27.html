      <p class="weather-lead">
        Today I just want to write. Not to explain anything, not to impress you —  
        just to let you see what moves through my head when it comes to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yesterday you sent me flowers.  
        And I keep thinking about how much effort you put into something that looks simple from the outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being born on December 27th means everything is closed here.  
        It has always been a strange, empty day —  
        too far from Christmas to matter, too close to New Year to exist properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet you still tried.  
        From another continent.  
        In a language you don’t speak.  
        Calling florists, insisting, hoping someone would help you.  
        I can picture you trying, getting frustrated, trying again, refusing to give up.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I don’t know why, but that image breaks me a little.  
        In the softest way.  
        You do so much more than you think.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I feel like you have no idea how big your heart actually is.  
        You talk like you’re chaotic, messy, difficult —  
        but every gesture you make for me is careful, thought out, full of intention.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that poem you wrote…  
        I read it again today.  
        It still feels unreal, like something I stumbled into by accident —  
        a version of love I didn’t think was meant for someone like me.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make me feel safe in ways that have nothing to do with protection.  
        It’s the emotional kind — the kind where my mind slowly unclenches.  
        Where I’m not scared of being seen all the way through.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep noticing little things about myself that changed because of you.  
        How I think differently.  
        How I’m softer without meaning to be.  
        How the world feels a bit warmer just because I know you're in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        And sometimes it feels like I’m living inside a dream.  
        Something too fragile, too beautiful, too impossible to hold.  
        I wake up and half expect the universe to take you away —  
        and I don’t know what I did to deserve that kind of fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re in everything now.  
        When I look at my phone.  
        When I walk outside.  
        When I see something beautiful and wish I could show you first.  
        When I talk and hear your reactions in my head.  
        When I imagine the future and your silhouette appears in all the empty spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think what I’m trying to say is…  
        I see you.  
        In all the small things.  
        In the effort you made for my birthday.  
        In your kindness.  
        In your chaos.  
        In the way your heart spills out without you noticing.
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        And if I ever forget to say it out loud,  
        let this page remind you:
      </p>

      <p class="weather-ending">
        you’re woven into all the little things in my life now —  
        and I don’t want a world where that isn’t true.
